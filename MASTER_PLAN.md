## Project Vision
Create a mobile-first, viral-shareable price comparison platform for refurbished tech.
**Aesthetic:** "Apple meets Notion" — Light mode, premium, high-trust, minimalist, and ultra-modern.
**Key Features:** Interactive chat-based search, advanced price comparison logic, viral social sharing hooks.

## Timeline Estimate: 72–96 Hours
*Continuous work via sub-agents and main session handoffs.*

## Phase 1: Research & Setup (6-8 Hours)

- **Infrastructure:** Initialize `Codeofwinners/epicdeals.git` with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Phase 2: Core Engine Development (24-30 Hours)
- **Comparison Engine:** Improve the scraping/API aggregation logic for faster, more accurate refurbished pricing.
- **Chat Interface:** Build a high-performance, Notion-style chat UI for guided search.
- **Mobile First:** Ensure every component is touch-optimized and award-worthy on mobile.

## Phase 3: Visual Polish & Viral Hooks (24-30 Hours)
- **Animations:** Implement silky smooth Apple-style transitions.
- **Sharing Engine:** Create beautiful, shareable "Deal Cards" for social media (viral-ready).
- **Trust Elements:** Add high-tech, clean feedback loops that build user confidence.

## Phase 4: QA & Deployment (12-16 Hours)
- **Stress Testing:** Test the price engine under load.
